				Burials on Hart Island are projected to skyrocket by the end of our newest pandemic

			<h2>Why a tiny, innaccessible island deserves New York City's respect as the final burial ground for our poor and forgotten.</h2>

			<p class="intro">"It disappeared off the radar because either the mayor or the city lawyers made it disappear," says Melinda Hunt, President of The Hart Island Project. </p>
			<p>
				Viral footage of incarcertaed men in hazmat suits burying bodies on Hart Island scared New York and the world at the height of what now looks to be the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then it went away. New York City, as it has for
				decades, was eager to
				hide it's only final resting place available to all New Yorkers from the poor, to the homeless, to stillborn infants, and, of course, pandemic victims.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's not a shameful thing," says Hunt. "A city burial is a much safer option for people and it's free." Burials here are also environmentally responsible, using a natural process that fully returns bodies to the soil within three decades,
				leaching no harmful chemicals into the ground water.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hunt began her work documenting the bodies that the city tries to hide in the 1980s during the AIDS pandemic. "So many of my friends died. Friends couldn't bury friends and gay marriage was illegal." Hunt used to photograph the island then to
				remember them by; now photography is forbidden.
			</p>
			<p> "They were buried in an area that was previously a sewage treatment plant," she says, near tears. Even today, the names are almost all anonymous. </p>
			<p> Hunt and other activists hope that after our most recent pandemic, the island will be turned over to the National
				Park Service and finally given the respect these people, and their loved ones, deserve. </p>

					}))
				}();
			</script>
			<p> The Hart Island Project sued the City of New York to obtain the records of those buried since the end of 2019 when the current records end. "Bad today doesn't mean bad tomorrow, so we'll get it turned around," says Hunt of the lawsuit. The
				litigation is still pending. </p>
